OpenRouter API Key Integration for LLM Features (Claude, ChatGPT)
Step 1: UI/UX for API Key Integration
Settings/Integration Menu:

Add a section in settings labeled "Connect to OpenRouter for AI Assistance."
Description: "Integrate OpenRouter to use AI models like Claude or ChatGPT to assist with brainstorming, writing prompts, and content generation."
"Connect" Button: Redirect users to OpenRouter for authentication using OAuth PKCE for secure login.
Step 2: OAuth PKCE Flow
Redirect for Authentication: When the user clicks the "Connect" button, redirect to:

arduino
Copy code
https://openrouter.ai/auth?callback_url=YOUR_SITE_URL
Optionally include a code_challenge using the S256 method for security.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
const generatedCodeChallenge = await sha256CodeChallenge(code_verifier);
window.location.href = `https://openrouter.ai/auth?callback_url=${YOUR_SITE_URL}&code_challenge=${generatedCodeChallenge}&code_challenge_method=S256`;
Receive Authorization Code: After logging in, OpenRouter will redirect the user to your site with the authorization code in the URL:

css
Copy code
YOUR_SITE_URL?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
Exchange Authorization Code for API Key: Use the authorization code to get the API key:

typescript
Copy code
fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/keys', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    code: $CODE_FROM_QUERY_PARAM,
    code_verifier: $CODE_VERIFIER, // only if using code_challenge
  }),
}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => {
  const apiKey = data.key;
  // Store the API key securely
});
Step 3: Using the API Key for LLM Integration
Once the API key is obtained, it can be used to interact with models like Claude or ChatGPT for generating writing prompts or assisting with brainstorming.

Example of a request to OpenRouter’s API:

typescript
Copy code
fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "model": "claude-v1", // Use Claude or another LLM
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful writing assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Help me brainstorm a plot for a mystery novel."}
    ]
  })
}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => {
  // Process the AI response (e.g., show plot suggestions in the UI)
});
Step 4: UI Feedback and Notifications
Loading States: Show loading animations during authentication or AI response generation.
Error Handling: Display clear error messages for issues like failed authentication or API limits.
Step 7: Integration Testing
Ensure the following are tested thoroughly:

OAuth PKCE flow (both with and without code_challenge).
Handling and storing API keys.
Error handling for invalid tokens or network failures.
