   - **API Key Testing**: The `testApiKey` function checks the validity of the provided key, handling success or error messages accordingly.

2. **Model Selection**
   - **Dynamic Model Population**: The available models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) are populated dynamically into the accordion for user selection.
   - **Cost and Usage Analytics**: When a model is selected, the `updateCostDisplay` function displays model-specific costs (prompt and completion costs).

3. **Testing API Connection**
   - The `testConnection` function tests the API connection by sending a request with a pre-defined prompt and providing feedback to the user.
   - **Modal Dialog**: Displays the results of the connection test, including token usage and cost breakdown.

4. **Usage Analytics Charts**
   - **Charts.js** is used to create charts for **Token Distribution**, **Cost Breakdown**, and **Credits Remaining**.
   - Data is updated dynamically based on API responses.

5. **Error Handling and User Guidance**
   - Includes error messages for incorrect API keys, insufficient funds, or network issues to guide users in resolving issues effectively.

5. **Start Button Activation**
   - The **Start** button is only enabled once both a language and a genre have been selected, ensuring that users complete the required steps before proceeding. Clicking the button navigates to the story-setting page.

### **Story Setting Page Overview**

The provided files (`story-setting.html` and `story-setting.js`) represent the story setting and timeline selection phase of the Novel-Writing App. This page allows users to specify the location and timeline of their story, further personalizing their novel-building journey.

### **HTML Structure (story-setting.html)**

The `story-setting.html` file creates an interface for selecting the story's location and timeline. Key components include:

5. **Next Button Activation**
   - The **Next** button is only enabled once both a location and a timeline have been selected. When clicked, it saves the user's progress and navigates to the character development page.

### **Observations and Recommendations**

1. **User Experience Improvements**
   - **Progress Indicators**: The progress bar could be made more interactive, showing users exactly which steps they have completed and what's remaining.
   - **Selection Feedback**: Adding visual feedback (like a subtle animation) when users select a location or timeline could enhance user engagement.

2. **Visual Consistency**
   - Ensure consistent design across all selection cards (e.g., location and timeline) to maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the user journey.

3. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Add **ARIA roles** to the location and timeline selection options to improve accessibility for users relying on screen readers.
   - Ensure tooltips are accessible, providing alternative descriptions for users who cannot visually interact with the tooltips.

4. **Guidance and Feedback**
   - **Guidance Messages**: Make guidance messages more visually distinct when the user is ready to proceed, perhaps using colors or icons that differ from the default text style.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Progress Indicator Enhancement**
   - Make the progress bar interactive to reflect the user's progress through the different stages of novel building.

2. **User Feedback Enhancements**
   - Add animations or auditory feedback for user selections to improve the overall engagement.

3. **Accessibility Audit**
   - Conduct a thorough accessibility audit across all pages to ensure screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation are fully supported.

4. **Code Optimization and Documentation**
   - Continue adding comments to JavaScript code for clarity, aiding future developers in understanding the codebase.

   For the documentation, please make sure to note:

1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: The Tailwind CSS configuration has been moved to an external file named `tailwind-config.js` for better maintainability and easier management of styling settings. This file should be updated for any changes to the Tailwind configuration.

2. **Inline Styles**: Inline styles are still present in the `<style>` section of the HTML. Consider moving these styles to an external CSS file in the future for further separation of concerns, maintainability, and ease of reuse across other parts of the application.
